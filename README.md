## React with Express - SSR Demo

Basic configurations for SSR react webapp with express.

I have created an SSR react app. In there, I have used reach router for routing. Currently it is working correctly except with image. When I add image, it runs properly in dev but it doesn't work with server file. Maybe issue while adding "App.js" in /server/server.js. So I commented the image code.
